# NoIPAM -  No(t really a) IP address management tool

image:https://travis-ci.org/tolleiv/noipam.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/tolleiv/noipam"]

This tool enables to keep track of used IP addresses and maintain relations between addresses. It is not used to manage IP pools, has no IPv6 support yet, has no user management, has no statistics module or anything too fancy. Its focus lies on the REST API to support automation, the minimal Bootstrap WebUI is just meant to get better insights.

## Why?

When auto provisioning servers, DHCP isn't the right choice and manual association isn't nice either.
Therefore this tool provides a service with a nice API to help automating provision processes. Our surrounding tools already have IP pools preconfigured just the actual IP blocking was not available as a service. That's why this ended up as a very slim tool for just that purpose.

## Installation

Make sure you have node and npm available, then just:

     $ git clone https://github.com/tolleiv/noipam.git
     $ npm install
     $ npm start

Running the tests

     $ npm test

## Usage

Check if IP is in use:

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/ip/10.20.70.11
    --> free | used

Mark IP as used/unused

    $ curl -X PUT     -s http://localhost:3000/ip/10.20.70.11
    $ curl -X DELETE  -s http://localhost:3000/ip/10.20.70.11

Get an available IP from a subnet

    $ curl -X POST    -s http://localhost:3000/net/next/10.20.70.0/24

List the remaining or used IPs for a subnet

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/net/remaining/10.20.70.0/24
    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/net/used/10.20.70.0/24

List all connections for one IP address

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/connection/10.9.1.3

List all connections for a network

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/net/connected/10.9.1.0/24

Add a "connection" relation between two addresses

    $ curl -X PUT     -s http://localhost:3000/connection/10.9.1.3/to/2.2.2
    $ curl -X DELETE  -s http://localhost:3000/connection/10.9.1.3/to/2.2.2

## WebUI

Ever API endpoint which is available via GET can also be used with the "?pretty=html" query param - which then shows a nicer view for human users.

Right after the installation just open up `http://localhost:3000/?pretty=html` and you'll be able to start working with in.
