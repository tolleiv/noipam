# NOIPAM no IP address management tool

image:https://travis-ci.org/tolleiv/noipam.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/tolleiv/noipam"]

This tool enables to keep track of used IP addresses and maintain relations between addresses. It is not used to manage IP pools, has no IPv6 support yet, has no statistics module or anything too fancy. Its focus lies on the REST API, the minimal Bootstrap WebUI is just meant to get better insights.

## Why?

When auto provisioning servers, DHCP isn't the right choice and manual association isn't nice either.
Therefore this tool provides a service with a nice API to help automating provision processes.

## Installation

Make sure you have node and npm available, then just:

     $ git clone https://github.com/tolleiv/noipam.git
     $ npm install
     $ npm start

Running the tests

     $ npm test

## Usage

Check if IP is in use:

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/ip/10.20.70.11
    --> free | used

Mark IP as used/unused

    $ curl -X PUT     -s http://localhost:3000/ip/10.20.70.11
    $ curl -X DELETE  -s http://localhost:3000/ip/10.20.70.11

Get an available IP from a subnet

    $ curl -X POST    -s http://localhost:3000/net/next/10.20.70.0/24

List the remaining or used IPs for a subnet

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/net/remaining/10.20.70.0/24
    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/net/used/10.20.70.0/24

List all connections for one IP address

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://localhost:3000/connection/10.9.1.3

Add a "connection" relation between two addresses

    $ curl -X PUT     -s http://localhost:3000/connection/10.9.1.3/to/2.2.2
    $ curl -X DELETE  -s http://localhost:3000/connection/10.9.1.3/to/2.2.2

## Usecases

...

## WebUI

Ever API endpoint which is available via GET can also be used with the "?pretty=html" query param - which then shows a nicer view for human users.

## Not yet included

 * IPv6
 * Bulk imports via API (just use a Bash script=
 * Blocking / unblocking with the WebUI
