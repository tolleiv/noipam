# NOIPAM ... no IP address management tool

image:https://travis-ci.org/tolleiv/noipam.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/tolleiv/noipam"]

This tool enabled to keep track of used IP addresses and maintain relations between addresses. It is not used to manage IP pools, has no IPv6 support yet, has no statistics module or anything too fancy. Its focus lays on the REST API, the minimal Bootstrap WebUI is just meant to get better insights.

## Usage

Check if IP is used

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://_service_/ip/10.20.70.11
    --> free | used

Mark IP as used/unused

    $ curl -X PUT     -s http://_service_/ip/10.20.70.11
    $ curl -X DELETE  -s http://_service_/ip/10.20.70.11

Get an available IP from a subnet

    $ curl -X POST    -s http://_service_/net/next/10.20.70.0/24

List the remaining or used IPs for a subnet

    $ curl -X GET     -s http://_service_/net/remaining/10.20.70.0/24
    $ curl -X GET     -s http://_service_/net/used/10.20.70.0/24

## WebUI

Ever API endpoint which is available via GET can also be used with the "?pretty=html" query param - which then shows a nicer view for human users.

## Why?

When auto provisioning servers, DHCP isn't the right choice and manual association isn't nice either.
Therefore this tool provides a service with a nice API to help automating provision processes.

## Not yet included

 * IPv6
 * Bulk imports via API (just use a Bash script=
 * Blocking / unblocking with the WebUI
